  '2. 2.9 billion fag ends\n\n'
  + 'In 1848, Berlin proved itself to be way ahead of its time by banning smoking in the street. Now it is one of the few cities in western Europe where smoking in bars is still the norm. Today 2.9 billion fag ends litter the capital’s streets every year',

  '7. 18 people move every hour\n\n'

  + 'Berlin\'s public transit system (BVG) actually travels the equivalent distance of 8.7 times around the Earth each day, including all the U-Bahn and buses together - even though you might sometimes doubt the existence of buses as they always seem to run a bothersome five minutes late.\n\n'

  '20. One in five underground station escalators don\'t work because: idiots\n\n'
